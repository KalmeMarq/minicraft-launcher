# Minicraft Launcher
The old ones are on [KalmeMarq/minicraft-launcher-tauri](https://github.com/KalmeMarq/minicraft-launcher-tauri) and [KalmeMarq/minicraft-launcher-electron](https://github.com/KalmeMarq/minicraft-launcher-electron) and this new version starts from 0.1.0 again and uses the same identifier, so uninstall the older one.

A launcher for all Minicraft versions and mods. Includes +190 version mods.

The UI is based on the Minecraft Launcher (it's pretty).
