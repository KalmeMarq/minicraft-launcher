# Minicraft Launcher
The old one is on KalmeMarq/minicraft-launcher and the renew starts from 0.1.0 again and uses the same identifier, so uninstall the older one. "Renew" is only used in the repository name.

A launcher for all Minicraft versions and mods. Includes +190 version mods.

The UI is based on the Minecraft Launcher (it's pretty).
